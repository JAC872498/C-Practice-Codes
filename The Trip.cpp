/*Each trip consists of a line containing a positive integer n denoting the number of students on the trip.
This is followed by n lines of input, 
each containing the amount spent by a student in dollars and cents.
For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of money, in dollars and cents,
that must be exchanged to equalize the studentsâ€™ costs.*/
